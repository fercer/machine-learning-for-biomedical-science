# Basic Machine Learning

Machine learning is a very broad topic and a highly active research
area. In the life sciences, much of what is described as "precision
medicine" is an application of machine learning to biomedical data. The
general idea is to predict or discover outcomes from measured
predictors. Can we discover new types of cancer from gene expression
profiles? Can we predict drug response from a series of genotypes? Here
we give a very brief introduction to two major machine learning
components: clustering and class prediction. There are many good
resources to learn more about machine learning, for example the
excellent textbook *The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining,
Inference, and Prediction*, by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and
Jerome Friedman. A free PDF of this book can be found
